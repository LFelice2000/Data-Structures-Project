The first change that I have made is add a new field on the Arraydel structure to store the last position accessed by the next fit, this field 
is called lastPosition.

In order to add the next_fit algorithm, first we have to see if is the first iteration or we already did one search with this algorithm, for this 
we have an if iside add.c, this is the following if statement: if(strategy == NEXTFIT && (int)delindex->lastPosition > -1), so if we execute with 
the next fit option we will skip the next fit search algorithm for this time and after doing the firs fit search (only the first time) we will 
save the las position accessed on the deleted list: 

if(i == ((int)delindex->used - 1)) {

    delindex->lastPosition = 0;

} else {

    delindex->lastPosition = i;
}

Note: if we add the record on the last position then we will start the search from the top (position 0).

Finally in the main.c I have added two functions, void register_las_position(int pos, char *filename) and int get_last_nextfit_position(FILE* filename).
The function register_las_position will write on a binary file the last position accessed by the next_fit algorithm, the function get_last_nextfit_position
will recover the previously saved integer and with the return value of that function we will save it on the lastPosition variable on the Arraydel structure.
